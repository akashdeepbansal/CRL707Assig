VoIP

Voice over Internet Protocol (also voice over IP, VoIP or IP telephony) is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet.
involve signaling, channel setup, digitization of the analog voice signals, and encoding. Instead of being transmitted over a circuit-switched network
They transport audio streams using special media delivery protocols that encode audio and video with audio codecs, and video codecs.


Voice conversion
It aims to change one or more aspect of a speech signal while preserving linguistic information.
Voice conversion specifically aims to change a source speaker's speech in such a way that the generated ouptput is perceived as a sentence uttered by a target speaker.
Mimicking spectrally and prosodically is still challenging.

VC modifies speaker-dependent characteristics of the
speech signal, such as spectral and prosodic aspects, in order to
modify the perceived speaker identity while keeping the speakerindependent
information (linguistic contents) the same.
